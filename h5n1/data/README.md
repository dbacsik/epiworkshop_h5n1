# README
This data was downloaded manually from GISAID on 2024-02-22. H5N1 seqeunces from Argentina, Brazil, and Peru were selected. The HA and NA sequences were downloaded into two separate files.

The header for the FASTA file has the following format:
`Isolate name | avian_flu | Isolate ID |  Collection date | south_america | Originating lab`

# Pruning
Manually removed strains labelled `A/Pelecanus/Peru/VFAR-140/2022` because they are duplicate in the dataset.
