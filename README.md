# Epi Workshop H5N1
by [David Bacsik](https://mstp.washington.edu/student/david-bacsik/) in collaboration with [Pablo Tsukayama](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/external_person/tsukayama-pablo/)


This is a repository for analyzing South American H5N1 data. It is being prepared for the UPCH Genomic Epidemiology workshop in March 2024.

This Nextstrain build is based on and uses a lot of code from the simplified avian-flu build called "[quickstart](https://github.com/nextstrain/avian-flu/tree/master/quickstart-build)", created by [Louise Moncla](https://lmoncla.github.io/monclalab/).
