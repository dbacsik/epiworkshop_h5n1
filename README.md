# Epi Workshop H5N1

This is a repository for analyzing South American H5N1 data. It is being prepared for the UPCH Genomic Epidemiology workshop in March 2024.

This Nextstrain build is based on and uses a lot of code from the simplified avian-flu build called "[quickstart](https://github.com/nextstrain/avian-flu/tree/master/quickstart-build)", created by [Dr. Louise Moncla](https://lmoncla.github.io/monclalab/).
