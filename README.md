# Epi Workshop H5N1
by [David Bacsik](https://mstp.washington.edu/student/david-bacsik/) in collaboration with [Pablo Tsukayama](https://investigacion.cayetano.edu.pe/catalogo/saludintegral-genomicamicrobiana/)


This is a repository for analyzing South American H5N1 data. It is being prepared for the UPCH Genomic Epidemiology workshop in March 2024.

This Nextstrain build is based on and uses a lot of code from the simplified avian-flu build called "[quickstart](https://github.com/nextstrain/avian-flu/tree/master/quickstart-build)", created by [Louise Moncla](https://lmoncla.github.io/monclalab/).

## Results
1. The large majority of South American sequences are derived from a single transmission event in mid-late 2022.  
2. There were several other introductions around the same time that either did not spread widely or have not been adequately surveilled.
3. The first sequences detected in South America were in Colombia (2022-10-09) and Peru (2022-11-10).
4. The epidemic has generally spread from North to South, and has now reached Antarctica.
