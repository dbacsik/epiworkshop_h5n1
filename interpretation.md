# Interpretation

## Initial state
2024-02-24: Got the repo working with all of the Peru, Brazil, and Argentina data on GISAID. Built a tree with a high (10; is that high?) number of samples per country per month. Notes from this run:
- The tree is not ladderlike, providing no suggestion of selection.
- There is significant time heterogeneity in when samples from most countries are produced. Specifically, Peru was well sampled in late 2022, Argentina was well sampled in early 2023, and Brazil has only begun to be sampled in mid 2023. There are a few samples from each country from late 2023.
- Based on this tree, it appears as if virus that circulated in Peru seeded the population in Argentina in late 2022, and pepersisted in Peru as well. The population in Argentina made two introductions into Brazil, one in April 2023 and one in June 2023; again, the local population persisted. I do not know whether these inferences of transmissions are well-founded or not.
- The mutation rate of this virus in South America is ~4e-3 subs per site per year. This is better seen in the scatter plot than the clock, due to some distant (in time) samples skewing the regression too much. There is variation around this average, but the rate does not appear to be trending up or down over time.
