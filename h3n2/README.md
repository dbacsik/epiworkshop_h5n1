# Epi Workshop H3N2
by [David Bacsik](https://mstp.washington.edu/student/david-bacsik/) in collaboration with [Pablo Tsukayama](https://investigacion.cayetano.edu.pe/catalogo/saludintegral-genomicamicrobiana/)


This is a repository for analyzing South American H3N2 data. It is being prepared for the UPCH Genomic Epidemiology workshop in March 2024.

This Nextstrain build is based on the simplified avian-flu build called "[quickstart](https://github.com/nextstrain/avian-flu/tree/master/quickstart-build)", created by [Louise Moncla](https://lmoncla.github.io/monclalab/).

## Results
The following results have been confirmed in 3 replicates, with random subsampling of global sequences for context.

1. There is dense sampling of H3N2 in Brazil, Argentina, and Peru. This is consistent across time. This permits inferences of transmission into and out of these countries.  
2. There are usually multiple lineages of H3N2 virus circulating in South America at the same time.
Introductions into South America come from many different regions. Asia is the most often source, but North America, Europe, and Oceania also occur frequently.
3.  Local outbreaks in South America spread within and between neighboring countries.
4.  Genetically similar viruses detected in other regions of the world are  sprinkled within South American clusters on the tree, suggesting long-range transmission (e.g. by air travel).

*N.b.* I think *this analysis overestimates the rate of transmission out of South America* because there are so many more South American genomes compared to other continents. Based on my understanding, South America exports seasonal influenza strains less often than other continents, and less often than it imports them. This is also what the [main global Nextstrain build](https://nextstrain.org/flu/seasonal/h3n2) shows.
