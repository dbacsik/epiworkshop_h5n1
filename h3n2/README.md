This repository analyzes South American H3N2 data from 2018-06-01 to 2024-03-01. It is being prepared for the UPCH Genomic Epidemiology workshop in March 2024.

This Nextstrain build is based on the simplified avian-flu build called "[quickstart](https://github.com/nextstrain/avian-flu/tree/master/quickstart-build)", created by [Louise Moncla](https://lmoncla.github.io/monclalab/).
